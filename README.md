# Proteomics Data Classification Using AdaBoost and XGBoost on data generated by PyOpenMS  

Step 1. - Download the data for HH "Class_H_H.zip" and LL "Class_L_L.zip" from the link https://cac.science.ru.nl/research/data/ecoli/.

Step 2 - After unzipping the folder for HH, run the ipynb file called "HH_Class.ipynb". "1.csv" for the flattened data for the six files from the folder Class_H_H.

Step 3 - After unzipping the folder for HH, run the ipynb file called "CLASS_L_L__ML_ANALYSIS_REVISED.ipynb". "L_Loutput1.csv" for the flattened data for the six files from the folder Class_L_L. The filr 1.csv from step 2 will be imported and the data for both the classes will be analysed in the same ipynb file.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on preparing **LC-MS/MS proteomics data** for machine learning classification. The dataset consists of protein spike samples divided into two classes: `LL` (low spike) and `HH` (high spike). The data was processed using **PyOpenMS**, with techniques like **binning** and **flattening** applied to transform the raw mass spectrometry data into structured numerical features suitable for ML models.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Full factorial LC-MS/MS proteomics benchmark dataset  
- **Samples:** 12 total (6 LL, 6 HH)  
- **Raw Data:** mzXML files containing retention time (RT) and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) for detected ions  
- **Processed Data:** After using PyOpenMS, the dataset was converted from high-dimensional peak measurements into **structured arrays**, where each sample is represented as a single row of numerical features reflecting the distribution of RT and m/z values.

## Techniques Applied
- **PyOpenMS:** For extracting features from raw LC-MS/MS data  
- **Binning and Flattening:** To reduce dimensionality and transform 2D peak patterns into 1D feature arrays  

The resulting dataset provides a clean, numerical representation of the original proteomics measurements, ready for training machine learning models like AdaBoost and XGBoost.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** PyOpenMS, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, AdaBoost  
- **Data Visualization:** Heatmaps and 2D histograms to visualize RT and m/z feature distribution  

## Notes
The project highlights the importance of preprocessing tools like PyOpenMS and demonstrates data binning and flattening as effective methods for reducing high-dimensional proteomics data before applying machine learning.
